The UDP implementation of the control protocol does not scale:
- Too many interrupts prevent the process from being scheduled.
- One UDP socket has to read all the packets and dispatch to
  working threads. The main thread becomes a bottleneck.

The UDP implementation of the control protocol is not the right approach:
- It does not allow reconfiguration throught NATs.
- It is handled at user space (see topic above).
